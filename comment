Good Job"
"Rework required

Though the program looks fine, its not meeting the objective of the problem statement.interface and inheritance approach was not followed"
"Rework required

Again, couldn't find generics in the program. Pls use generics here along with enum object"
"Rework required

Same program as Task 01. Pls read the problem statement. It requires values to be displayed in a toggled manner. Here we don’t see any thing as conditional display. You can use custom directives as well here"
"Completed

Neat Work"
